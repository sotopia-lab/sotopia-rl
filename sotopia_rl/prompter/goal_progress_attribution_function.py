You are given a conversation history between two agents. For now, you are the judge of the utterance of one of the agent, and your task is to judge how much of your agent's goal is achieved at certain point of the conversation. You will also be provided with the agent's final goal achieving score, which would help you in making the decision better. Note, the goal achieving score is between 0 and 10, where 0 means the goal is not achieved at all, and 10 means that the goal is fully achieved.

### Your Agent's Name:
{agent}
### Your Agent's Goal:
{goal}
