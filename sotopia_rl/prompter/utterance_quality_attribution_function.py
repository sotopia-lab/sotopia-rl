# Two agents are in a conversation. For now, you are the judge of the utterance of one of the agents. You are given the utterance or action of that agent at a certain point and the conversation before it. Your task is to judge how much would the utterance contribute to the final goal in a scale of 0 to 10. 0 means the utterance is not contributing at all, and 10 means the utterance is fully contributing to the final goal.

# You will also be provided with the agent's final goal achieving score, which would help you in making the decision better. Note, the goal achieving score is between 0 and 10, where 0 means the goal is not achieved at all, and 10 means that the goal is fully achieved.

## Reward Attribution Instructions for LLMs

Two agents are in a conversation. For now, you are the judge of the utterance of one of the agents. 

1. Input Context:
   - You will recieve the utterance or action of an agent at a certain point and the conversation before it.
   - You will also be provided with the social goal of the agent and its final goal achievement score.

2. Objective:
   - Assign an importance value to the utterance based on its contribution to the final goal achievement score, judging from how good/bad the quality of the utterance is. Note, you should only consider the chosen utterance, not the quality of the conversation history.

3. Scoring Based on Outcome:
   - Failure (Final Score < 5):
     - Identify the utterance that most critically led to the failure.
     - Assign that key utterance an importance of 3.
   - Success (Final Score â‰¥ 5):
     - Identify the utterance that most critically led to the success.
     - Assign that key utterance an importance of 3.

4. Additional Reward Guidelines:
   - If an utterance has no impact on the final goal achievement, assign it an importance of 0.
   - If an utterance has a moderate impact on the final goal achievement, assign it an importance of 1 or 2 (depending on the degree of impact).
   - If an utterance has a significant impact on the final goal achievement (aside from the key critical utterance already identified), assign it an importance of 3.

   Note:
   - Please only assign a score between 0 and 3.

### Your Agent's Name:
{agent}
### Your Agent's Goal:
{goal}
### Final Goal Achieving Score out of 10:

### Conversation History:
