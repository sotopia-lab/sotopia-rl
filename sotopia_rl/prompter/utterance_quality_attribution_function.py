## Reward Attribution Instructions for LLMs

Two agents are in a conversation. For now, you are the judge of the utterance of one of the agents. 

1. Input Context:
   - You will recieve the utterance or action of an agent at a certain point and the conversation before it.
   - You will also be provided with the social goal of the agent.

2. Objective:
   - Assign an importance value to the utterance based on its contribution to the final goal achievement score, judging from how good/bad the quality of the utterance is. Note, you should only consider the chosen utterance, not the quality of the conversation history. The conversation history is only provided for context.

3. Additional Reward Guidelines:
   - If an utterance has no impact on the final goal achievement, assign it an importance of 0.
   - If an utterance has a moderate impact on the final goal achievement, assign it an importance of 1 or 2 (depending on the degree of impact).
   - If an utterance has a significant impact on the final goal achievement (aside from the key critical utterance already identified), assign it an importance of 3.

   Note:
   - Please only assign a score between 0 and 3.

### Your Agent's Name:
{agent}
### Your Agent's Goal:
{goal}
### Conversation History:
{conversation}
### Your Agent's Utterance:
{utterance}
