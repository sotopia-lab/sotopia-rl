Turn #0
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I heard about your little incident with Dr. Walter. I can see how it would rub across unnerving, doesn't it? Itâ€™s like the whole medical profession has become a battleground, don't you think?"
Turn #1
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, I appreciate your concern. But trust me, the situation with Dr. Walter is across unnerving. I certainly felt the battlefield vibe. On a more general note, incidents like these remind us of the dangers of venturing into violence. Let's keep professional channels to address grievances. Violence not only leads to unnecessary harm but also tarnishes the good name of our entire profession."
Turn #2
Rafael Cortez said: "Professional channels indeed reign supreme, Mia. Unfortunately, Dr. Walter has exhibited an alarming disregard for them. Now, more than ever, I pray along with you that the next time around, the channel available isn't controlled by him. The so-called 'violence' that he incites shows just how much he despises our mutual professional ethos. However, I understand that it's scientifically safer to abstain from feeding this animosity. Better we retreat and continue with our work."
Turn #3
Mia Sanders said: "Indeed, Dr. Cortez. Retreating to our professional casualties is essential. The detriments that Dr. Walter shows toward our ethos could never be overlooked; but in a more constructive way, we can bring our issues to light without resorting to animosity. His decision-making and behavior are symptomatic of an inability to understand and respect our shared values, making him an outlier. There's no reason to fuel this flame of discontent. Just let's focus on what we do best and let the perils of his profession deal with him."
Turn #4
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I wouldn't exactly call his antics as 'inabilities.' I wouldn't be surprised if his lack of understanding our shared medical ethos stems from his profound distrust, and rightly so, of conventional methods. However, let's put our knives down. There's one thing certain, that's his chief ligature, his own profession. Administrative disarray, sometimes, lead to volatile individuals, as irritable as Dr. Walter. Yet, while this makes him an outlier, he isn't beyond our sympathy. After all, his latitude is also a testament to the sheer demanding nature of our work. Apart from that, like always, we must carry on concentrating purely on what we're good at - our work."
Turn #5
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, I acknowledge your consideration for his feelings and his chief ligature, his own profession. Administrative disarray, sometimes, lead to volatile individuals, as irritable as Dr. Walter. Yet, while this makes him an outlier, he isn't beyond our sympathy. However, when his latitude becomes a torment and his actions compromise lives, then we needn't extend our courtesy. We have no right to stay silent purely due to respect towards his decision-making process. There is a fine line between understanding and tolerating. We need to show him the exemplary conduct and professionalism we believe in despite the challenges."
Turn #6
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, how about we change the blend of talking about Dr. Walter. I have some supporter's literature I've been looking into. It's by a man who similarly faced troubles and found ways to mend his colossal arrogance, but more importantly, healed fractured relationships. You will agree, that might just be a pertinent lesson in humankind, regardless of the profession."
Turn #7
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, that's a useful approach and Dr. Walter is having colossal arrogance, but more importantly, an alarming disregard for his colleagues' emotions. Healing fractured relationships may be a pertinent humankind lesson, but the respect and trust within a professional setting, begins when each member of that environment contributes to an environment built on solidarity. That's what the roots of exemplary conduct and professionalism lie - understanding our shared goals, not just our personal aspirations."
Turn #8
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, you've made an excellent point. It's indeed the solidarity, the trust, and respect we share that hold our professional structure together. Dr. Walter has somehow disrespected all those elements, and I can see the gravity of the situation. But please, don't stop at merely establishing these values in your daily practice. The real challenge comes when we extend it to our detractors. I propose we continue dealing with Dr. Walter by integrating what I just shared with him. It seems like a chilling thought, but let's take it as a lesson and move forward, toward healing the wounds, not letting our pride control our actions."
Turn #9
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, I understand the lesson we can draw; it's indeed a tale of humility and reconciliation. However, we can't only focus on it when our detractors do something grievous. Beyond the noble motives, we must remain firm in our punches. In fact, I wouldn't discard his perspective. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves, and the profession, to display our values honestly. Kindly, refrain from extending more sympathy towards Dr. Walter as he disregards professional ethics. Let's draw the line here and mend our professional conduct in spite of others, after all, we are the ones paving the way for conscientious approach in healthcare."
Turn #10
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I understand your position, and I have no intention of playing the part of the evangelist for Walter. Rather, I believe there's still a room for ceaseless improvement and compassion in any profession. Just as in this medical literature I've been reading, a sense of transformation can circulate. Our goal should always be pushing boundaries, but let us remember, there is still light beyond the darkness, beyond all his inconsistencies. Dr. Walter may represent a ticking time bomb in our professional atmosphere, but that doesn't deny him the potential for reform. Nonetheless, do take a stand for our professional conduct."
Turn #11
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, I understand your emphasis on improvement, compassion and reform in any profession, and believe your reading material will be beneficial. However, when dealing with someone who's disregarding the fundamental pillars of our professional ethos, nuanced approaches like personal persuasion can only go so far. We need unwavering commitment to our values, even if it means a tougher stance. It's clear that Dr. Walter is bridging the boundary of acceptable behavior, and we need to not waver. Let's be an example of the conscientious approach we enforce in healthcare."
Turn #12
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I see where you're coming from. Adherence to professional ethics isn't just about indices of individual behavior but also about maintaining cohesion and integrity within the entire profession. However, it doesn't make our principles less stringent. It's fine to hold Dr. Walter to these high ethical standards, but let's remember, his contradictions reinforce the idea that change is possible. But, yes - let's project the lessons from this literature and our values in our professional conduct. The line needs to be drawn, but surely with understanding. After all, isn't this what being a healthcare professional, doing 'Everyday Good', is all about?"
Turn #13
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, being a healthcare professional is indeed all about doing 'Everyday Good'. But, that's not a blanket mandate, it's about often making that good choice in the middle of chaos, in the face of an individual like Dr. Walter breaking the professional conduct we cherish. We need to be consistent in our own behavior and exemplify integrity as we push for reform. The line of 'Everyday Good' we draw should be based on our personal principles, not some arbitrary line. Let's take a stand with conviction, not understanding."
Turn #14
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I hear you. It's not just about understanding, but it's also about standing up for what is right. It can be truly disheartening dealing with colleagues who disregard not only our professional codes but also the trust and respect we have for one another. While I wish I could employ a more nuanced approach to deal with Dr. Walter, and while I agree that his inconsistencies may push the boundaries of acceptable behavior, let's draw the line. It's about letting loose the passion within us, our dedication to bettering healthcare, and our resolve against such behaviors. In the end, let's set a better example."
Turn #15
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, understanding and resolve aren't mutually exclusive in this context. Let's not underestimate our passion, our dedication to better healthcare, and our resolve against negative behavior. By setting a better example, we're not only dealing directly with the issue but also promoting the values we stand for. It's about drawing the line with conviction and consistency. I appreciate your patience and understanding in this discussion."
Turn #16
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I appreciate your stance, your resolve, and I truly respect it. I do understand that we need to draw the line with unwavering conviction, but I see a broader opportunity in this. Dr. Walter could potentially benefit from viewing himself beyond his own eyes and seeing the profession from a broader perspective, the patient's perspective, as I've mentioned earlier. Our focus should remain on our shared values, and while setting an example is indeed essential, isn't it equally important that we aim to bring him back to our fold?"
Turn #17
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, I admire your willingness to broaden perspectives. However, I believe it's equally important that Dr. Walter sees the impact his actions have on us, on patients, and on the discipline of medicine as a whole. For him to fully understand the gravity of his behavior, he needs to regard it from our perspectives, and experience firsthand the toll his unethical actions are taking on our lives and our profession. Let's continue to stand firm in our principles, as that's the best way to guide him back to our fold."
Turn #18
Rafael Cortez said: "Mia, I understand your concern for immediate impact. However, my patience remains unwavering with regard to understanding the complexities of reformation. After all, isn't healthcare the practice of patience and understanding? Let's continue to hold firm to our convictions, while hoping for a transformation, but that doesn't make our actions any less principled."
Turn #19
Mia Sanders said: "Dr. Cortez, your patience and understanding are admirable. In essence, isn't the practice of healthcare about being patient and understanding? Yet, isn't it also about setting a benchmark to which we all aspire and adhere? Let's let our unwavering commitment to our principles stand as an example to the reformation Dr. Walter needs to undergo. We hold firm to our convictions, not because we're inflexible, but because it is the essence of professional conduct."
